## Context

**Shinouske** was implementing a security feature in the Kubernetes cluster to streamline logging events. Unfortunately, he was in a rush due to a prior commitment and didn't have time to review the changes he made. After Shinouske left, his friend and colleague **Kazama** noticed that the kube-apiserver was down, rendering the cluster inaccessible.

## Task

Help **Kazama** ensure the API server is brought back online. In simple terms, the kubectl get pods command should function as expected.

<details><summary>Tip #1</summary>
<br>
Check the relevant logs related to the API server.

<details><summary>Tip #2</summary>
<br>
Thereâ€™s nothing in the `/var/log/pods/` or `/var/log/containers/` directories.<br> Let's check the system logs for the API server using `journalctl | grep "apiserver"`.<br>

This entry regarding a `hostPath` type check seems promising.
