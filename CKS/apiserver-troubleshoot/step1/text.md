## Context

Shinouske was trying to implement a security feature in the kubernetes cluster to make logging events easier. Sadly he was in a hurry, and had a date to attend so he could not check the changes he had made. After Shinouske left, his friend and colleauge Kazama saw that the kube-apiserver was down and thus the cluster was no longer accessible.


## Task

Help Kazama, to ensure that the API-server is back online. In simple terms `kubectl get pods` should work as expected.
